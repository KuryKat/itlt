### üìù Notes

-   All branches are actively maintained, but don't worry! For contributing, you only need to submit a PR to one branch (of your choice) and I'll handle porting to the rest after merging your PR.
-   If you want to add support for a Minecraft version that doesn't already have a branch, open a dev support ticket and I'll make the branch for you so you can make your PR.
-   There are two versions of this mod
    -   v2 which is the latest version that has been rewritten from the ground up. All work on new features is being done in v2.
    -   v1 is the original mod which has been backported to legacy Minecraft versions and gets maintained with minor bugfixes and changes.

### Branches

#### Current

Work for the latest supported Minecraft version is done on the "master" branch, however mod update checking always uses named branches to ensure reliability during a switchover to a newer MC version. When 1.18 comes out, master is merged onto 1.17 and 1.18 work goes on master. Until then, the 1.16 branch serves as a placeholder for update checking.

#### Legacy

These are still maintained, but are worked on much less often due to being harder to setup and work with in general.

I've provided `Instructions.md` and some additional files in each of these branches to help. I strongly recommend you read the instructions if you're not already familiar with the process, otherwise you're going end up spending a while troubleshooting. These Python scripts no longer work out of the box like they used to - they need a bit of manual setup and a specific environment to work in. RetroGradle aims to eventually port these MC versions to use ForgeGradle 4 but it's a long way off - possibly years from now.
